  <h1><a name="A1">Description</a></h1>

  <p><a name="A1">McTwit is a free, open source desktop client for
  Twitter.com, a popular social networking site. The program is
  designed for productivity by keyboard users. Additionally, if the
  JAWS, System Access, or Window-Eyes screen reader is active, some
  information is conveyed efficiently through direct speech messages.
  Such messages are also displayed on the status line for visual
  users.</a></p>

  <p>McTwit works on almost any version of Windows, including 64-bit
  Vista. Its use of standard controls tends to maximize accessibility.
  Programmed in a cross-platform language, the source code is also
  relatively easy for interested developers to port to other operating
  systems. A command-line version of McTwit is included in the
  distribution, as well as the more powerful GUI version.</p>

  <p>Twitter is being used to get bulletins about public or company
  news with links to web pages for more information. People ask quick
  questions or express informal opinions on Twitter that they would not
  do by email. Direct, private messages may also be exchanged.</p>

  <p>McTwit&#39;s flexible, direct access to Twitter features makes it
  convenient to explore and communicate interactively. You can select a
  user either by pointing to a list item or entering a screen name. Get
  a list of someone&#39;s tweets, followers, or leaders with a single
  keystroke. Go to a related URL, subscribe to tweets, post a public
  reply, or send a private message. McTwit offers full access to a
  leading networking technology!</p>

  <h1><a name="A2">Installation</a></h1>

  <p><a name="A2">The installer for McTwit is called mtsetup.exe. The
  default location for the program is<br>
  C:\Program Files\McTwit</a></p>

  <p>The installer also creates a desktop shortcut and a program group
  within the Windows Start Menu, with options to launch the program,
  read documentation, upgrade, or uninstall. At the end of the
  installation process, there are checkboxes to install optional JAWS
  or Window-Eyes scripts that offer some enhancements created by script
  developers for these screen readers. Among other things, the scripts
  offer email-like alternatives to McTwit commands, e.g., Control+N for
  a new tweet, Control+R for a direct reply, or Control+Shift+R for a
  public reply. For more information, use the ways that each screen
  reader provides script help, or contact the script authors.</p>

  <p>The default shortcutkey for McTwit is Alt+Control+M. If the
  program is already running when an attempt to launch it is made, the
  existing window is activated, rather than opening another copy.
  McTwit may also be opened by entering its name in the Windows
  Start/Run dialog.</p>

  <h1><a name="A3">Overview</a></h1>

  <p><a name="A3">The McTwit program is a single, dynamic dialog
  divided into three sections from top to bottom: (1)a labeled listbox,
  (2) a labeled, multi-line, read-only edit box, and (3) many buttons,
  spanning the alphabet in three rows. The title of the dialog is
  &quot;McTwit - &quot; and the screen name of the Twitter account
  holder.</a></p>

  <p>The listbox shows multiple message or user items from Twitter. Its
  label, located to the left, indicates the selected user and item
  type. The edit box -- also called the viewing area -- shows
  additional information about the current item in the list, e.g., the
  time of a message and the full name of the user who posted it. Each
  button performs an action, often to fill the list with a particular
  type of item.</p>

  <p>All controls in the dialog may be accessed with a unique, mnemonic
  keystroke -- generally an Alt+Letter combination. For example, Alt+I
  focuses on items in the list, Alt+V focuses on the viewing area, and
  Alt+N invokes the New button, which filles the list with new messages
  by those you are following. This button is also the default, so it
  can be invoked by pressing Enter unless another button has focus.
  Buttons after New are in an alphabetical sequence until the Help and
  Close buttons at the end. The Close button, or Escape key, prompts
  for confirmation, whereas Alt+F4 closes McTwit immediately.</p>

  <p>The dialog offers numerous choices, yet they are aided by online
  help, and may be memorized as needed. Since a button in a standard
  Windows dialog may be invoked with a combination of Alt and the
  initial character of its label, McTwit tries to create mnemonics with
  the initial characters of commands. Some of them are unconventional,
  e.g., beginning with a number or punctuation mark, because all
  letters of the alphabet are used. If a key combination is memorable,
  however, it serves its purpose. To aid learning, a description of
  each control is available on the status line when the control has
  focus. screen readers have a hotkey to read the status line (e.g.,
  Insert+PageDown in JAWS and System Access, or Control+Insert+S in
  Window-Eyes). If you are keeping current with Twitter, McTwit
  commands tend to be remembered through regular use.</p>

  <p>Several commands operate in relation to a particular user, which
  McTwit calls the &quot;selected user.&quot; If no items are contained
  in the list, McTwit considers the selected user to be the active
  account, which has a display name of &quot;My.&quot; Otherwise, the
  selected user is obtained from the currently selected item in the
  list. If the type of item is a message, the selected user is the
  sender of the message. To re-establish yourself as the selected user,
  press Alt+0 for the 0items command, which clears the list. To specify
  a selected user by typing a scree name rather than pointing to a list
  item, press Alt+1 for the 1other command, which prompts you for the
  other user to be referenced by subsequent commands. This setting
  takes precedence over a user referenced in a list item, so should be
  cleared to a blank value when no longer needed.</p>

  <p>When a command is invoked to fill the list with items of a
  particular type, McTwit says the number of items it received from
  Twitter -- or says &quot;Error&quot; if there was a problem. This is
  an example of a direct speech message, which is also presented
  visually on the status line. In general, when a command is invoked,
  McTwit clears the status line and writes the name of the command
  there. Then, when subsequent speech messages are given over the
  course of the command, their text is appended to the status line.</p>

  <p>In some cases, the goal of a command is not to fill the list or
  edit box with information. Commands that send messages are in this
  category. In such cases, McTwit says &quot;Done!&quot; if Twitter
  indicates a valid result. Otherwise, McTwit conveys error
  information.</p>

  <h1><a name="A4">Quick Start</a></h1>

  <p><a name="A4">Create a Twitter account by using your web browser to
  open the site<br></a><a href=
  "http://twitter.com">http://twitter.com</a></p>

  <p>Launch McTwit from your desktop or via Alt+Control+M. Enter your
  screen name and password.</p>

  <p>Press Alt+N or Enter (for the default button) to get public
  messages (also called &quot;tweets&quot;) by people you are
  following. Press Alt+T to post a tweet yourself. Press Alt+D to get
  private, direct messages, or Alt+W to send one. Tab to the viewing
  area to get additional information about the current item in the
  list. Press Alt+H to review this documentation at any time, or to
  examine a command summary in the viewing area. A summary of the
  command with focus is shown on the status line.</p>

  <h1><a name="A5">Getting Messages</a></h1>

  <p><a name="A5">The New command, Alt+N, gets tweets by you or your
  &quot;leaders&quot; -- the McTwit term for users whom you are
  following. The Replies command, Alt+R, gets tweets that reference
  your screen name preceded by the @ sign -- a Twitter convention for
  replying publicly to someone, or publicly mentioning that person. The
  Direct command, Alt+D, gets direct messages sent privately to
  you.</a></p>

  <p>The ,bine command, Alt+Comma, combines New, Reply, and Direct
  messages in a single list. McTwit tracks the time stamps of such
  messages seperately, so you can get them again in each category with
  the individual buttons.</p>

  <p>Combined messages may also be retrieved automatically. The .auto
  command, Alt+Period, prompts for a time period in minutes for this to
  occur. The default is 0, meaning no automatic retrieval. As a
  protection against losing items of interest in the list, auto
  retrieval does not occur if the list is filled with items besides
  combined messages. To ensure it happens, press Alt+0 to clear the
  list. When combined messages are automatically added to the list,
  McTwit plays a chime sound to notify you. When navigating through the
  list of combined messages, the type of the current item is shown on
  the status line.</p>

  <p>The Sent command, Alt+S, gets direct messages that you have sent.
  The Messages command, Alt+M, gets tweets by the selected user. The
  \cache command, Alt+Backslash, gets favorite messages of the selected
  user.</p>

  <p>The Public command, Alt+P, gets messages from the &quot;public
  timeline&quot; -- recent tweets posted by anyone with a custom
  profile image. The 9rewind command, Alt+9, gets a chain of reply
  messages, starting with the current one. McTwit keeps looking for a
  prior message that is referenced, thus enabling you to read a
  conversation thread.</p>

  <h1><a name="A6">Sending Messages</a></h1>

  <p><a name="A6">The Tweet command, Alt+T, posts a public message by
  you, which is also called a &quot;tweet&quot; or &quot;updating your
  status.&quot; The 2tweet command, Alt+2, posts a public reply to the
  selected user. The 3tweet command, Alt+3, retweets the selected
  message. The Write command, Alt+W, sends a direct message to the
  selected user. As you type a message, McTwit updates the status line
  with the position of the cursor and length of the text. The length is
  limited to 140 characters, as required by Twitter. An attempt to
  input more text results in a beep by McTwit, alerting you that no
  more text may be added until you remove some text. The maximum length
  of text you may input is actually less than 140 for a reply, retweet,
  or direct message, since it needs to start with a prefix of
  @recipient, rt recipient, or d recipient, as a processing instruction
  to Twitter. McTwit adds the prefix automatically, and indicates the
  maximum length of content in the title of the input dialog.</a></p>

  <p>McTwit supports another form of retweeting via email. Press Alt+U
  for Utilities and then Enter for the default subchoice. A message is
  initiated in your default email program. The subject is &quot;Fwd
  from ScreeName on Twitter.&quot; The body is the text of the Twitter
  message. Edit as desired, specify a recipient, and send the
  message.</p>

  <h1><a name="A7">Managing Users</a></h1>

  <p><a name="A7">The Leaders command, Alt+L, gets users whom the
  selected user is following. The followers command, Alt+F, gets users
  who are following the selected user. The Join command, Alt+J, sets
  the selected user as one of your leaders, or toggles notifications of
  his or her tweets to your mobile phone. The ?relationship command,
  Alt+Shift+Slash or Alt+Question, reports whether a user is following
  another, and vice versa. The comparison is made between the selected
  user, the 1other user, or yourself.</a></p>

  <p>The Zap command, Alt+Z, removes something according to the type of
  item. The command deletes a tweet or direct message by you, or
  removes a favorite message from your cache. The command also drops
  someone as your leader, blocks someone as your follower, or removes
  that user from your blocked list (so you may be followed again). The
  |blocked command, Alt+Bar, displays those you have blocked.</p>

  <p>The Extra command, Alt+X, gets more information about the selected
  user, which is displayed in the viewing area. All available
  information about the user is shown. Also, if the current message is
  a reply, information about the prior message is shown first.</p>

  <h1><a name="A8">Navigating Items</a></h1>

  <p><a name="A8">The list of items supports navigation by arrow keys
  or the initial letter of an item. The Keywords command, Alt+K,
  searches for an item, starting at the top, based on text it contains.
  A match does not depend on capitalization. The Again command, Alt+A,
  searches for the next match, if any.</a></p>

  <p>The Order command, Alt+O, sorts list items in alphabetical,
  chronological, or recent order. Recent is the default, meaning that
  the most recent item appears at the top of the list, and the oldest
  appears at the bottom. The setting is remembered for subsequent
  lists.</p>

  <p>The Query command, Alt+Q, prompts for a &quot;regular
  expression&quot; for filtering the list. The syntax of regular
  expressions is an advanced topic that is beyond the scope of this
  documentation (many tutorials are available on the web). If no
  punctuation symbols are used, the regular expression acts like the
  keywords search, except that it searches all text of each message or
  user item, not just the part displayed in the list. Various
  punctuation symbols have special meaning in a regular expression, and
  they may be used to specify almost any condition or combination of
  conditions for text to be considered a match.</p>

  <p>For example, entering &quot;baseball&quot; (without the quotes) as
  a query expression would reduce the list to only those items that
  mentioned the sport, whether in associated message or user
  information. A query of &quot;baseball|golf&quot; would match either
  sport.</p>

  <p>When you press the Query button, McTwit offers subchoices called
  Priority, Rest, Input, and All. You can press Enter for the default,
  Priority button if you have defined a regular expression for this
  setting in the configuration dialog. For example, your expression
  could be a list of scree names seperated by the vertical bar
  character, e.g.,<br>
  User1|User2|User3</p>

  <p>This would filter the list so that it only contained messatges
  that included those names (ignoring capitalization). The Rest button
  displays the items that are not matched by that query.</p>

  <p>The Input choice prompts you for a regular expression to enter.
  The last one entered in the current McTwit session is the default
  value, so you may keep refining the expression by editing the
  previous one. The All choice matches all items in the list, removing
  any filter.</p>

  <p>The [store command, Alt+LeftBracket, temporarily saves the content
  and position of the list and viewing area. This may be useful if you
  want to check another list, and then show previous items again with
  the [restore command, Alt+RightBracket. Such information cannot be
  restored in another session of McTwit.</p>

  <h1><a name="A9">Miscellaneous Commands</a></h1>

  <p><a name="A9">The 7update command, Alt+7, lets you change some
  parts of your Twitter profile, including your full name, URL,
  description, and location. A summary of each field appears on the
  status line, including the maximum number of characters Twitter
  permits for that data.</a></p>

  <p>The 5orite command, Alt+5, puts the current message in your cache
  of favorites. The \cache command, Alt+Backslash, displays the
  favorites of yourself or the selected user.</p>

  <p>The Boundary command(Alt+B), sets an upper boundary on how many
  pages of items are to be retrieved from Twitter. The default is 0,
  meaning no limit. Since Twitter limits the amount of resources
  consumed by each user per hour, you may wish to use this command if
  you are running into resource limits. An indication of this problem
  is when no items are retrieved by McTwit, even though you are fairly
  sure that updates are available on the Twitter.com web site.</p>

  <p>The 4get command, Alt+4, prompts whether to forget wheher messages
  have been previously shown by McTwit. The default is No, thereby
  remembering what has already been shown. Choosing Yes instead will
  show all messages currently available from Twitter. The current value
  of this setting is the default button in the confirmation dialog of
  the command.</p>

  <p>The .auto, 1Other, 4get, Duplic8, and Boundary settings are
  remembered from one McTwit session to another. These settings may be
  changed either with the Configure dialog or individual commands.</p>

  <p>The Export command, Alt+E, saves text in the viewing area for the
  current item. The text is appended to a file called Export.txt in the
  McTwit data folder, located by default at<br>
  %AppData%\McTwit\Export.txt</p>

  <p>where %AppData% refers to the environment variable containing the
  location of the Windows special folder for Application Data.<br>
  This file is automatically opened in your default text editor after
  closing McTwit. You can then use the text in other ways. Delete the
  file if you want McTwit to start a new file in the next session.</p>

  <p>The Duplic8 command, Alt+8, toggles a mode in which a copy of each
  item you retrieve is stored automatically in the export file. If you
  think you will want to save a lot of items, turn on this mode before
  retrieving them. Toggle off the setting to stop appending to the
  file. The setting is remembered from one McTwit session to
  another.</p>

  <p>The Go command, Alt+G, looks for a URL in the current item. If not
  found within message text, McTwit looks for a URL in associated, user
  information. If found, McTwit prompts with an input box that gives
  you a chance to edit the URL or cancel the operation. If you accept a
  URL, it is opened in your web browser. If no items are in the list
  when you perform this command, McTwit offers a list of over 50
  Twitter-related web sites.</p>

  <p>The Yield command, Alt+Y, is a convenience for screen reader
  users. It says the number of items in the list and then reads their
  text.</p>

  <p>The Configure command, Alt+C, lets you change settings such as
  your screen name and password, which are needed for authorization by
  Twitter (if this information is not found when McTwit is loading, you
  are prompted for it). The command offers subchoices to change
  settings either via a dialog (the default button), or manually via a
  text editor. With the Manual button, the McTwit.ini configuration
  file is opened in the default text editor, and you must restart
  McTwit for any changes you save to take effect.</p>

  <p>Other subchoices are Reset, Create, and Switch. The Reset button
  invokes the dialog with default settings. The Create button invokes
  the dialog similarly, but after prompting for the name of a
  configuration file to create. The Switch button lets you pick one of
  the .ini files in the McTwit data folder, which are assumed to be
  configuration files.</p>

  <p>A different configuration file may also be passed to McTwit as a
  command-line parameter. Without one specified, its value is assumed
  to be<br>
  &quot;%AppData%\McTwit\McTwit.ini&quot;</p>

  <p>Note that the parameter is enclosed in quotes since it may contain
  spaces. A path with a different file or folder name may be passed as
  a parameter in order to manage another account on Twitter. If a file
  name without a folder is specified, McTwit assumes the McTwit program
  folder -- the one containing McTwit.exe. This allows McTwit to be run
  on portable media, where all files needed are stored in the same
  folder. As a convenience, the program folder contains a batch file,
  McTwitPortable.bat, for running McTwit in this situation.</p>

  <p>The configuration dialog includes settings that also have quick
  hotkeys, such as 1other, 4get, and Boundary. Other settings, changed
  less often, are also included such as SoundFile, User, and Password.
  A summary of the setting with focus appears on the status line.</p>

  <p>The CombinedProcessing setting specifies which commands are used
  to gather such messages: Direct, Replies, and/or New. The value of
  the setting may include three characters, each pertaining to one of
  these commands. The initial letter of a command means that it should
  be included in combined messages. If the letter is in upper case,
  then its type is also spoken when navigating the list with arrow
  keys. Otherwise, the type is not spoken, though it still appears on
  the status line. The default value is DRN -- meaning that Direct,
  Replies, and New commands are used and that each type is spoken.</p>

  <p>The EnhancedSpeech setting determines whether a screen reader API
  is used for targeted messages. For example, the =balance command says
  your rate balance if a screen reader API is found. Otherwise, the
  status line may be checked for such messages.</p>

  <p>The FullName setting may be used to specify that the full name of
  a user be shown in a list of messages. The default is for the screen
  name to be used.</p>

  <p>The RelativeTime setting specifies whether the time stamp of a
  message in the viewing area is conveyed as the difference from the
  current, local time. The default is to convey absolute dates and
  times. McTwit drops detail in a relative time to be more friendly,
  e.g., seconds are not shown if the difference is more than one
  minute.</p>

  <p>The SoundFile setting specifies a .wav file to play when automatic
  checking finds combined messages. The default is chimes.wav in the
  McTwit program folder. Leave the setting blank if no sound is
  desired.</p>

  <p>The JunkFilter setting specifies a regular expression for
  spam-type messages that you want to automatically exclude from being
  displayed. Key fields of each excluded item are appended to a file
  called Junk.txt in the McTwit data folder, one item per line. You can
  examine this file via a subchoice of the Utilities command,
  Alt+U.</p>

  <p>The /search command, Alt+Slash, prompts for tweets to find. A
  query may be entered using the same syntax as on the twitter.com web
  site. For example, you can search for the #McTwit hash tag.</p>

  <p>The -trends command, Alt+Dash, gets a list of the 10 most popular
  topics currently on Twitter. The =balance command, Alt+Equals, shows
  how much is left in your current &quot;rate limit&quot; on Twitter,
  which permits 100 &quot;hits&quot; per hour. The +elevate command,
  Alt+Shift+Equals or Alt+Plus, checks whether an update to McTwit may
  be installed.</p>

  <p>The Help command, Alt+H, presents this documentation in your web
  browser. In addition, a summary of commands is displayed in the
  viewing area, as well as in the following section.</p>

  <h1><a name="A10">Handy Utilities</a></h1>

  <p><a name="A10">McTwit has an extensive Utilities menu. It offers
  handy ways of getting useful information, which is obtained mostly
  from third-party web services rather than from twitter.com, itself.
  Some are still Twitter-related, while others are general-purpose
  conveniences that exploit free web 2.0 services with the Python
  programming language. The utilities are as follows:</a></p>

  <p>@User Stats - Get a variety of statistics about a user, e.g.,
  average tweets per day and hash tags used, in order to help you
  decide whether to follow him or her on Twitter.</p>

  <p>#Hashtag Lookup - Get definitions of hash tags (a word preceded by
  the # symbol). People on Twitter use these to annotate messages for
  easier categorizing and searching.</p>

  <p>:Dictionary Lookup - Get definitions and other information about a
  word.</p>

  <p>508 Check - Check a web page for compliance with accessibility
  standards of the United States Government (Section 508 of the
  Rehabilitation Act), as well as standards of the World Wide Web
  Consortium (W3C).</p>

  <p>Address Lookup - Search for addresses of organizations meeting
  geographic and other criteria.</p>

  <p>Business Reviews - Search for reviews of a business by inputting
  its phone number.</p>

  <p>Common URLs - Show a list of the 100 most commonly referenced URLs
  on Twitter at the time. These typically point to news stories that
  people have been retweeting.</p>

  <p>Driving Directions - Input a starting and ending location, and get
  a list of steps to get there by car (a blind person might share this
  with a friend or cab driver). The location may be specified as a
  street address in any country.</p>

  <p>Feed Find - Get a list of RSS and ATOM feeds made available by a
  web site, e.g., by pointing to a URL in a tweet. A hotkey then lets
  you open a feed at the cursor position.</p>

  <p>Google Search and Set Suggestions - Propose a Google search and
  get a list of popular searches that are similar. Also Get a list of
  terms that may be part of the same set.</p>

  web is at<br>

  <h1><a name="A13">Usage Tips</a></h1>

  <p><a name="A13">Check the label of the listbox for a reminder about
  what type of items it contains.</a></p>

  <p>Check the status line to review what enhanced speech messages
  McTwit produced over the cource of a command.</p>

  <p>Check the title bar to confirm the recipient of a message you are
  sending, and whether it will be a public reply or direct message.
  Clear the 1other setting (set it to a blank value) if the recipient
  is not someone from the current list item as you intend (the 1other
  setting takes precedence).</p>

  <p>Alt+D, Alt+R, and Alt+N always retrieve messages for you. Other
  commands may apply to the selected user, so press Alt+0 first if you
  want to ensure that they apply to you.</p>

  <p>If you are going to switch to another application and want
  combined messages to be automatically retrieved, press Alt+0 to
  ensure the list is cleared first.</p>

  <p>Significant processing is required for auto checks of combined
  messages, so specify a time period that balances frequency of checks
  and amount of items retrieved. 5 minutes may be a good, initial
  choice.</p>

  <p>Each setting in the Configuration and 7update subdialogs has a
  unique Alt+Character combination, so you can go to it directly.</p>

  <p>Twitter may return an error message for various reasons: you have
  reached a rate, page, or update limit; the server is busy; a request
  cannot be satisfied. The latter can happen because of invalid
  authorization, e.g., trying to send a direct message to someone when
  at least one of you is not following the other. It can also happen
  because the desired state is already present, e.g., trying to follow
  someone you are already following, or get phone notifications that
  you are already getting.</p>

  <p>If McTwit is behaving erratically, the cause may be temporary
  glitches with the Twitter API, sometimes due to overwhelming traffic.
  If McTwit problems persist, its configuration file may have become
  corrupt somehow. Try the Reset subchoice of the Configure command, or
  uninstall and then reinstall the program.</p>

  <p>Try to get technical support questions answered by other McTwit
  users, since the author may not be able to respond in a timely
  manner. Questions in public reply tweets to JamalMazrui are
  preferable to email because responses may benefit others who are
  following me. Use email for a complex issue that cannot be explained
  in a tweet. If McTwit is seriously unstable or nonfunctional, email
  the following error log, if found, in the body of a message:<br>
  C:\Program Files\McTwit\McTwit.exe.log</p>

  <p>If you do not find an error log, try running the console version
  of McTwit, which prints errors to the screen, e.g., by entering the
  following in the Windows Start/Run dialog:<br>
  c:\program files\mctwit\McTwitConsole.bat</p>

  <p>To examine leaders with notifications, use the following input to
  the Query command:<br>
  Notifications: True</p>

  <h1><a name="A15">Development Notes</a></h1>

  <p><a name="A15">For the technically interested, I developed McTwit
  in the Python language with several external packages: twyt,
  orderedDict, configObj, simpleJson, Layout by Code, PyWinAuto,
  wxPython, SayTools, and py2exe. The indentation-related features of
  the EdSharp editor<br></a><a href=
  "http://EmpowermentZone.com/edsetup.exe">http://EmpowermentZone.com/edsetup.exe</a><br>

  have been helpful in managing the formatting requirements of
  Python.</p>

  <p>The default location of source code for McTwit is<br>
  C:\Program Files\McTwit\source</p>

  <p>Its documentation is located at<br>
  C:\Program Files\McTwit\docs</p>

  <p>Thanks go to JeffBishop (Jeff Bishop) and BrianHartgen (Brian
  Hartgen) for developing Window-Eyes and JAWS scripts for McTwit,
  respectively.</p>

  <p>McTwit began as a command-line program. The GUI version also
  relies on the Twyt API. The remainder of this documentation is for
  users of the command-line client, or for developers who wish to use
  McTwit code in their own projects.</p>

  <h1><a name="A16">Change Log</a></h1>

  <p><a name="A16">McTwit 2.7 on March 7, 2010<br>
  Fixed the Follower and Leader commands based on updated Twitter API
  requirements. Made the installer for JAWS scripts work on 64-bit
  Windows.</a></p>

  <p>Added support for the recent API feature that standardizes
  retweets. The 3tweet command, Alt+3, now prompts whether to do a
  standard or custom retweet. The standard behavior does not allow one
  to add comments -- it is a verbatim relay of the prior text. The
  custom option works like before, allowing one to edit the text and
  add comments before or after the original text. There is less
  built-in support for a custom retweet in the Twitter API and web
  interface. It is like a tweet that indicates your source and sends a
  copy to the @author retweeted.</p>

  <p>The New command, Alt+N, now includes standard retweets sent by
  your leaders. The original author of a standard retweet is shown in
  the second line of the viewing area.</p>

  <p>The /search command, Alt+Slash, now prompts whether to search
  messages or users. The messages choice works like before. The Users
  choice will prompt for a search query, using the same syntax as the
  Find People page on the twittter.com web site. The results are
  displayed as a user list, similar to the Followers or Leaders
  command. Tab to the viewing area (or press Alt+V) for additional
  information about the selected user in the list. Press Alt+X for
  extra information. Use the Join command, Alt+J, if you want to start
  following the person.</p>

  <p>The 2tweet command, Alt+2, now prompts for confirmation if you
  start to reply publicly to a direct message.<br>
  Fixed a problem on Windows Vista and above where the McTwit window
  was not activated after populating a list of messages or users.</p>

  <p>Added the official Twitter blog to the list of URLs offerred by
  the Go command (when no items are in the list). Created a compilation
  of about 150 topics from the support section of the Twitter web site.
  The files TwitterHelpGuide.txt and TwitterHelpGuide.htm are located
  in the McTwit program folder. The HTML version may also be opened
  with the McTwit Help command, with an option in the McTwit program
  group of the Windows Start Menu, or with the following link.<br>
  <a href="TwitterHelpGuide.htm">file://TwitterHelpGuide.htm</a></p>

  <p>McTwit 2.6 on November 20, 2009<br>
  Added the Interesting Places utility, which searches for nearby
  places to eat, shop, or visit via NextStop.com. McTwit prompts for a
  location, which can be in the city, state format, or a complete
  address with commas seperating postal address lines. Also input the
  distance in kilometers to search from that location, and any words
  that you want to narrow the search, e.g., Chinese for that type of
  food. An excerpt from a review of each place is also included if
  available.</p>

  <p>Added to the 508 Check utility the report of Wave, a web
  evaluation checker from WebAim.org. Updated the Window-Eyes scripts
  distributed with McTwit.</p>

  <p>McTwit 2.6 on November 6, 2009<br>
  Enhanced the Quotes of the Day utility to Show a funny quote from
  IHeartQuotes.com before the motivational quotes from
  QuotationsPage.com. Enhanced the Extra Word Info utility to show
  synonyms and antonyms from words.BigHugeLabs.com, in addition to the
  definition and examples from Wordnik.com. Added a dash (-) prefix to
  the name of the Trend Topics utility, so it has the same activation
  character as the -Trends choice in the main dialog of McTwit. Renamed
  the People Search utility to Twitter Name Search, invoked with the
  letter T on the utilities menu. Added the Virtual White Pages
  utility, which is like searching the white pages of U.S. phone books
  for listings of residential phone numbers and postal addresses. Added
  the ZoomInfo Contact Search utility, which enables searches for
  employment contacts by name or email address. Added Twitter lists of
  the New York Times to the Go command, as well as twittorati.com,
  which lists the 100 most popular blogs on Twitter.</p>

  <p>McTwit 2.6 on November 5, 2009<br>
  Included JAWS scripts that enhance functionality in the viewing area.
  Added twittorati.com to the Go command. Also added a Twitter Guide
  Book that gathers tips and instructions from the web<br>
  <a href=
  "http://mashable.com/guidebook/twitter/">http://mashable.com/guidebook/twitter/</a></p>

  <p>McTwit 2.6 on November 4, 2009, Second update<br>
  Tried another Unicode fix. Included latest Window-Eyes scripts, which
  significantly enhance functionality in the viewing area, e.g., F8 to
  start a selection and Shift+F8 to complete it.</p>

  <p>McTwit 2.6 on November 4, 2009<br>
  Tried another Unicode fix. Added listorious.com and TLists.com to Go
  command.</p>

  <p>McTwit 2.6 on November 3, 2009<br>
  Fixed the Language Translation utility not working with a source
  language besides Unknown. Fixed character encoding problems that
  occasionally arise when getting tweets. Tried to fix report spammer
  option when blocking a follower (hard to test because I do not have a
  spammer to report at present!). Made utilities consistently say
  &#39;Setting view area&#39; so you know when results have been
  retrieved from the Internet. Added the Extra Word Info utility, which
  gets definitions of a word and examples of its use via
  wordnik.com.</p>

  <p>McTwit 2.6 on October 29, 2009<br>
  Added the TwitDiff and TwitDone web sites to the Go command. Added
  the Address Lookup utility, which gives address information on
  organizations via jigsaw.com. McTwit prompts for an organization
  name, area code, zip code, web site type, and fortune rank. Fill in
  one or more fields for the search. For example, input gov for the web
  site type in order to get government organizations, or 500 in the
  fortune field to get companies in the top fortune 500.</p>

  <p>McTwit 2.6 on October 27, 2009<br>
  Enhanced the Language Translation utility so that it shows the source
  language that was detected. Added the Yahoo! Term Extractions
  utility, which reports noteworthy noun phrases contained in a web
  page. Added the :Dictionary Lookup utility (invoked directly with the
  : character), which gives definitions and other information about a
  word via wiktionary.com.</p>

  <p>McTwit 2.6 on October 26, 2009<br>
  Added a Background button to the Go subdialog, allowing you to open a
  URL in another window but keep McTwit as the active one. Enhanced the
  Google Suggestions utility to provide set as well as search data. For
  example, enter a comma-seperated list of U.S. presidents and let
  Google suggest a more complete list. Added the Quotes of the Day
  utility, which offers daily food for thought from several famous
  quotes and their authors.</p>

  <p>Added the URL Downloads utility for batch downloading files based
  on an initial URL and the extensions of files linked to it. McTwit
  analyzes the web page and puts a space-seperated list of extensions
  in an input box. Edit it so that only the extensions you want remain.
  McTwit then puts a list of those links in a multiple-selection
  listbox, showing the link text and URL for each. The items are all
  selected by default, but you can use arrow keys and Spacebar to
  unselect ones as desired. The next dialog prompts for a folder for
  saving the files, which will be remembered as the default choice the
  next time. McTwit says the name of each file as it is being
  downloaded.</p>

  <p>Enhanced all utilities that take a URL as input so they can use
  the web address in the most recently opened window of Internet
  Explorer. McTwit uses that address if it did not find a URL in the
  current list item or viewing area. If no such address is found,
  McTwit uses the last value specified as input for that utility. Thus,
  to ensure the IE address is used, press Alt+0 to clear the list
  before invoking the utility. To ensure that the last value is used,
  ensure that IE is closed.</p>

  <p>Renamed a couple of utilities so that each still has a unique,
  initial character for direct activation from the utilities menu. The
  new names are @User Stats and #Hashtag Lookup.</p>

  <p>McTwit 2.5 on October 22, 2009<br>
  Added support for mentions as well as replies by processing 2tweet
  command like 3tweet command with regard to the vertical bar (|)
  character. Added 508 Check utility, which checks a web page against
  U.S. Section 508 accessibility standards via CynthiaSays.com (the
  site limits checks to one per minute from the same location).</p>

  <p>McTwit 2.5 on October 20, 2009<br>
  Fixed bug in Short URL utility. Changed to upper case RT in syntax
  for 3tweet command. Added Twitter-related web sites and removed
  duplicate entries for a current total of 100.</p>

  <p>McTwit 2.5 on October 19, 2009</p>

  <p>Added three utilities: Business Reviews, Google Search
  Suggestions, and Recommended URLs. Added &quot;Handy Utilities&quot;
  section of documentation.</p>

  <p>McTwit 2.5 on October 15, 2009<br>
  Fixed the zapping of a favorite message. Added an option to report
  someone to Twitter as a spammer when blocking the user as a
  follower.</p>

  <p>Added the People Search utility for finding someone on Twitter
  based on keywords such as name or location. McTwit prompts for the
  keywords (e.g., the first and last name of an old class mate), and
  then passes the request to the Twitter web site, which prompts for
  credentials if you are not currently logged in. A checkbox lets you
  be remembered so you are not prompted for subsequent searches. The
  search results page includes buttons to follow people who were
  found.</p>

  <p>Added the Language Translation utility. This uses the Google
  Translate API to translate text of up to 500 characters between about
  100 natural languages. The default text is from the selected message.
  In this case, the source language is unknown and you just pick the
  target language. If the list is empty, you pick the source language
  as well, and enter text in the multi-line edit box. The translated
  text is shown in the viewing area. You can test this functionality by
  pressing Alt+P for the Public timeline, arrowing to a message in
  another language, and then pressing Alt+U followed by L for the
  language translation of that text.</p>

  <p>In order to maintain unique letters for each item on the Utilities
  menu, some were renamed. The new names are Common URLs, Members of
  Congress, and Trend Topics.</p>

  <p>McTwit 2.4 on October 13, 2009<br>
  Fixed the Go command not opening a web page chosen from the list of
  Twitter-related URLs. Enhanced the command so that it goes to a URL
  in the viewing area if focus is on a URL and no items are in the
  listbox. Enhanced the Hash Tag Lookup utility to check TagDef.com as
  well as Tagalus.com.</p>

  <p>Added the Feed Find utility. It prompts for a web source and
  returns a list of RSS or ATOM feeds found. An http:// prefix is
  assumed if not specified. For example, entering<br>
  cnn.com</p>

  <p>finds two RSS feeds related to top stories and latest stories. You
  can press Alt+G on a feed URL to read its content or subscribe with a
  feed reader.</p>

  <p>Updated the portable version of McTwit at<br>

  <p>McTwit 2.4 on October 12, 2009 (second update)<br>
  Enhanced the Weather Check utility with a web page from
  braille.wunderground.com. This works with city, country locations as
  well as U.S. zip codes. Added the Officials in Congress utility via
  the API of SunlightLabs.com. This prompts for a U.S. zip code and
  then shows information about corresponding Senators and
  Representatives, including their Twitter screen name if any. Added
  TweetMeNews.com to the list of Twitter-related URLs available with
  the Go command (when the list is empty).</p>

  <p>McTwit 2.4 on October 12, 2009<br>
  Changed Short URL utility to use j.mp.com rather than TinyURL.com for
  even shorter URLs. Added more utilities: Long URL, Driving
  Directions, Neighborhood Search, and Weather Check. Long URL does the
  reverse of Short URL, prompting for a URL, converting it, and copying
  the result to the clipboard. Driving Directions prompts for a
  starting and ending address, uses the Google Maps API, and puts the
  estimated distance, duration, and steps in the viewing area. Specify
  an address as if you were addressing an envelope except for a comma
  rather than return between each line, e.g.,<br>
  1201 East-West Highway, Silver Spring MD 20910, USA</p>

  <p>USA is assumed as the country if not specified. Neighborhood
  Search prompts for an address in the same format and also for one or
  more keywords specified as if searching on Google, e.g.,<br>
  seafood steak</p>

  <p>to find restaurants in the area that serve both seafood and steak.
  Weather Check prompts for a Yahoo! location ID, which may be a zip
  code in the U.S. A summary of current conditions and forecast is
  provided in Celcius.</p>

  <p>McTwit 2.3 on October 10, 2009<br>
  Fixed serious bug introduced by alternate HTML parser that prevented
  getting tweets (testing in the development environment did not reveal
  the bug). Subsequently, made the fix compatible with Windows XP.</p>

  <p>McTwit 2.3 on October 9, 2009<br>
  Fixed bug recently introduced in Extra command (Alt+X). Included
  latest Window-Eyes script package in the McTwit distribution.</p>

  <p>Changed 3tweet command so that text may be inserted before the rt
  @ScreenName: syntax. You can seperate text before and after that
  syntax with a vertical bar character (|). If no vertical bar is found
  in the tweet you input, McTwit puts all text after the special
  syntax.</p>

  <p>Used an alternate HTML parser to permit ampersand (&amp;) and
  other characters that Python&#39;s HTML parser was sometimes
  mistaking for unknown HTML entitity references, and then dropping.
  Added Short Url choice to Utilities subdialog. Enter a URL, and a
  shortened version will be pasted to the clipboard using the
  TinyURL.com service. You can then paste it into a tweet. An http://
  prefix is automatically added by McTwit if you do not enter it before
  the domain name.</p>

  <p>McTwit 2.3 on October 8, 2009<br>
  Fixed 3tweet command by inserting a colon (:) after the @ScreenName
  in accordance with new Twitter syntax. Fixed more Unicode issues.
  Added choices to the Utilities subdialog using more third-party APIs:
  Current Trends, Hash Tag Lookup, Popular URLs, and User Stats.
  Depending on the type and lengh of information retrieved, it is
  presented in a message box, in the viewing area, or in a web
  page.</p>

  <p>McTwit 2.2 on October 7, 2009</p>

  <p>Added a subdialog to the Zap command with options to unfollow the
  selected user, block that person from following you, or delete the
  current message. Added several more Twitter-related web sites to the
  Go command (when no items are in the list). Changed the Go command so
  that it has a subdialog with two choices. The Open choice goes to the
  referenced URL as before. The Inquire command tries to get more
  information about the URL from a third-party Twitter API, e.g., the
  title of the web resource, its media type, and an excerpt. If
  information is available, it is shown in a message box.</p>

  <p>McTwit 2.1 on July 20, 2009</p>

  <p>Fixed not all properties being updated when switching
  configurations.</p>

  <p>McTwit 2.1 on July 14, 2009</p>

  <p>Made installer recognize Program Files folder rather than hard
  coding C:\Program Files (generally the location, but not necessarily,
  e.g., the drive could be other than C:).</p>

  <p>McTwit 2.1 on July 13, 2009<br>
  Made configuration file encoded as UTF-8.</p>

  <p>McTwit 2.1 on July 10, 2009</p>

  <p>More Unicode changes in trying to support Chinese.</p>

  <p>McTwit 2.1 on July 9, 2009<br>
  Another Unicode fix. Added OrderItems setting to Configuration
  dialog, equivalent to Alt+O command, and renamed choices to recent,
  chronological, or alpha. Type the initial letter of a choice (lower
  case recommended though not necessary). Alt+O also makes the current
  setting the default button.</p>

  <p>McTwit 2.1 on July 8, 2009</p>

  <p>Fixed various Unicode errors. Increased ability of scripts to
  control McTwit settings dynamically. Fixed #trends command not
  working when a junk filter is set.</p>

  <p>McTwit 2.1 on July 2, 2009</p>

  <p>Fixed Alt+L or Alt+F not working when the selected item is a user
  rather than message item. Included significantly updated Window-Eyes
  and JAWS scripts in the McTwit distribution. Seperated out URLs to
  audio presentations on McTwit in a new section of documentation
  called Other Help Resources.</p>

  <p>McTwit 2.1 on July 1, 2009</p>

  <p>Fixed enhanced speech on Window-Eyes versions before 7.0. Added
  subchoices to Join command for control over tweet notifications to
  your mobile phone. Added Notifications field to viewing area of a
  user, without requiring Alt+X for extra info. Dropped fields related
  to color preferences from extra info.</p>

  <p>McTwit 2.0 on June 30, 2009</p>

  <p>Changed technique of how the Window-Eyes API is used for enhanced
  speech, resulting in such messages being spoken more immediately
  rather than queued. Fixed how the selected user is obtained from
  /search message results, so that Followers, Leaders, Messages, and
  Extra commands now work in that context.</p>

  <p>McTwit 2.0 on June 29, 2009</p>

  <p>Posted a zipped version of McTwit for unarchiving onto a portable
  drive,<br>
  <a href=
  "http://EmpowermentZone.com/mtsetup.zip">http://EmpowermentZone.com/mtsetup.zip</a></p>

  <p>An included file, AutoRun.inf, will automatically start McTwit on
  a drive that is configured to react to this file when storage media
  is inserted. Typically, however, removable drives are not configured
  this way by default as a security measure. RunMcTwitPortable.bat to
  start the program manually when logged onto the drive.</p>

  <p>Added information to Extensions.ini to further help scripting.
  Added McTwitC.exe, a console version of McTwit, to help debug systems
  where the program crashes. Running that executable, or
  McTwitConsole.bat, should print error messages on the screen.</p>

  <p>McTwit 2.0 on June 26, 2009</p>

  <p>Made the Reset and create subchoices of the Configure command
  delete the ini file if found, ensuring that a completely new one is
  created. Made the uninstaller delete McTwit.ini from the McTwit data
  folder, so that if the program is reinstalled, a new configuration
  file will be created. Added to the Usage Tips section of
  documentation. Mentioned in the Install section that another way of
  opening McTwit is entering its name in the Windows Start/Run
  dialog.</p>

  <p>McTwit 2.0 on June 25, 2009</p>

  <p>Tried a correction for time stamp being off by a day during
  certain periods. Fixed JunkFilter. Fixed ]restore command not working
  when list of users is restored to list of messages.</p>

  <p>McTwit 2.0 on June 20, 2009</p>

  <p>Added capability for screen reader scripts to suppress enhanced
  speech messages by setting EnhancedSpeech to No in Extensions.ini --
  a file that may be created in the McTwit data folder.</p>

  <p>McTwit 1.9 on June 17, 2009</p>

  <p>Added shortcuts to update JAWS or Window-Eyes scripts in the
  McTwit program group within the Windows Start Menu. Created
  SayLine64.exe and SayFile64.exe utilities to better support McTwit on
  64-bit Windows.</p>

  <p>McTwit 1.9 on June 16, 2009</p>

  <p>Added options at the end of installer for JAWS scripts by Brian
  Hartgen or Window-Eyes scripts by Jeff Bishop.</p>

  <p>McTwit 1.9 on June 8, 2009</p>

  <p>Fixed the Twitter account name not being updated in the McTwit
  window title after creating a new configuration. Fixed the -trends
  command not working if a junk filter is set. Fixed the Extra command
  not treating the account holder as the selected user if no items are
  in the list.</p>

  <p>Enhanced the McTwit installation so there is another way to load
  the program: enter either McTwit.exe or just McTwit in the Windows
  Start/Run dialog. Added more links in the documentation to audio
  presentations about Twitter.</p>

  <p>McTwit 1.9 on June 4, 2009</p>

  <p>Fixed McTwit window being activated after auto check for combined
  messages. Fixed Twitter authorization command not being re-issued
  after switching to another McTwit configuration file. Added Elevate
  shortcut to McTwit program group within the Windows Start Menu, so
  McTwit may be elevated without running the program.</p>

  <p>McTwit 1.9 on June 3, 2009</p>

  <p>Added the Create and Switch subchoices to the Configure command.
  The screen name of the Twitter account holder is now shown in the
  title of the main dialog. Added more Twitter-related web sites for
  the Go command, and made McTwit remember the previous choice. Added
  an Email subchoice to the Utilities command.</p>

  <p>McTwit 1.8 on June 1, 2009</p>

  <p>Added the RelativeTime configuration option. Added a summary of
  configuration settings to the documentation.</p>

  <p>McTwit 1.8 on May 28, 2009</p>

  <p>Fixed /search command getting only one page of results. Fixed auto
  check not happening for combined messages. Enhanced Go command so
  that if no items are in the list, McTwit offers over 50 Twitter
  related URLs.</p>

  <p>McTwit 1.8 on May 27, 2009<br>
  The configuration dialog includes settings that also have quick
  hotkeys, such as 1other, 4get, and Boundary. Other settings, changed
  less often, are also included such as SoundFile, User, and Password.
  A summary of the setting with focus appears on the status line.</p>

  <p>The CombinedProcessing setting specifies which commands are used
  to gather such messages: Direct, Replies, and/or New. The value of
  the setting may include three characters, each pertaining to one of
  these commands. The initial letter of a command means that it should
  be included in combined messages. If the letter is in upper case,
  then its type is also spoken when navigating the list with arrow
  keys. Otherwise, the type is not spoken, though it still appears on
  the status line. The default value is DRN -- meaning that Direct,
  Replies, and New commands are used and that each type is spoken.</p>

  <p>The EnhancedSpeech setting determines whether a screen reader API
  is used for targeted messages. For example, the =balance command says
  your rate balance if a screen reader API is found. Otherwise, the
  status line may be checked for such messages.</p>

  <p>McTwit 1.7 on May 20, 2009</p>

  <p>When you press the Query button, McTwit offers subchoices called
  Priority, Rest, Input, and All. You can press Enter for the default,
  Priority button if you have defined a regular expression for this
  setting in the configuration dialog. For example, your expression
  could be a list of scree names seperated by the vertical bar
  character, e.g.,<br>
  User1|User2|User3</p>

  <p>This would filter the list so that it only contained messatges
  that included those names (ignoring capitalization). The Rest button
  displays the items that are not matched by that query.</p>

  <p>The JunkFilter setting specifies a regular expression for
  spam-type messages that you want to automatically exclude from being
  displayed. Key fields of each excluded item are appended to a file
  called Junk.txt in the McTwit data folder, one item per line. You can
  examine this file via a subchoice of the Utilities command,
  Alt+U.</p>

  <p>The Zap command, Alt+Z, removes something according to the type of
  item. The command deletes a tweet or direct message by you, or
  removes a favorite message from your cache. The command also drops
  someone as your leader, blocks someone as your follower, or removes
  that user from your blocked list (so you may be followed again). The
  |blocked command, Alt+Bar, displays those you have blocked.</p>

  <p>The ?relationship command, Alt+Shift+Slash or Alt+Question,
  reports whether a user is following another, and vice versa. The
  comparison is made between the selected user, the 1other user, or
  yourself.</p>

  <p>The 7update command, Alt+7, lets you change some parts of your
  Twitter profile, including your full name, URL, description, and
  location.</p>

  <h1><a name="A17">MT Client</a></h1>

  <p><a name="A17">Also included in the McTwit distribution is a
  console-mode, command-line client. This executable, mt.exe, is

  ---------------------------------------------------</a>

  <p>How to use<br>
  ------------</p>

  <p>This file used to list the commands available in twyt before its
  online help<br>
  system became sane. This is now available by using the three handy
  command forms:</p>

  <p>twyt --help<br>
  twyt --commands<br>
  twyt COMMAND --help</p>

  <p>Your first tweet<br>
  ------------------</p>

  <p>Here&#39;s how to tell twyt which username you want to use by
  default:</p>

  <p>twyt user set --user=yourusername ---default</p>

  <p>This will prompt you for your password to save it to your profile.
  You can<br>
  leave it blank if you would prefer not to save your password, but
  then you will<br>
  be prompted for your password each time twyt needs it (which can get
  annoying<br>
  very soon).</p>

  <p>Here&#39;s an example of the two commands you&#39;re most likely
  to use often:</p>

  <p>1. twyt tweet &quot;My first tweet&quot;\!</p>

  <p>This sets &#39;My first tweet!&#39; as your Twitter status
  message.*</p>

  <p>2. twyt friendstl</p>

  <p>This lists up to the last 20 status messages in your friends
  timeline. (Your<br>
  friends timeline is the aggregation of your status messages and
  your<br>
  friends&#39; status messages. The 20 limit is enforced by Twitter but
  you can<br>
  use the -s option to get earlier tweets. You can also use the -P
  option to<br>
  get the next page of status updates.)</p>

  <p>* Note that in command 1 the exclamation mark needed some extra
  escaping magic.<br>
  This is because bash treats ! specially and even putting it inside
  the quotes<br>
  doesn&#39;t work.</p>

  <h1><a name="A22">How to install twyt</a></h1><a name="A22"><br>
  -----------------------</a>

  <p>o Dependencies<br>
  - python &gt;= 2.5 (perhaps earlier, haven&#39;t tested yet)<br>
  - simplejson</p>

  <p>o Intro<br>
  twyt uses distutils for its standard installation procedure so the
  setup.py<br>
  script provides installation routines. Note that it doesn&#39;t
  provide<br>
  uninstallation routines. If you require uninstallation and upgrade
  handling,<br>
  that&#39;s what package managers are for. Consider using one.</p>

  <p>o Installation<br>
  To install twyt to the default place on your system, run as root:</p>

  <p>./setup.py install</p>

  <p>If you wish to install it to a different root or prefix (e.g.<br>
  --prefix=/usr/local) see ./setup.py install --help for options.</p>

  <h1><a name="A23">How to use the twyt Python module</a></h1><a name=
  "A23"><br>
  -------------------------------------</a>

  <p>o This document is written for developers who are interested in
  using the twyt<br>
  Python module for developing Twitter applications. If you only wish
  to use<br>
  the twyt commandline program, consult the README and the twyt man
  page for<br>
  further information.</p>

  <p>o The Twitter API functions are encapsulated in the
  twitter.Twitter class. This<br>
  is really all you need to start using the basics of twyt but other
  modules<br>
  and classes are provided to allow you to make sense of the data
  returned from<br>
  Twitter. Here we briefly describe how to post a status message,
  delete it and<br>
  then list the public timeline:</p>

  <p>from twyt import twitter, data</p>

  <p>t = twitter.Twitter()<br>
  t.set_auth(&quot;username&quot;, &quot;password&quot;)</p>

  <p>return_val = t.status_update(&quot;Testing 123&quot;)</p>

  <p>The above snippet instantiates a Twitter object and then tells it
  the user&#39;s<br>
  Twitter user name and password. It then calls the Twitter
  object&#39;s<br>
  status_update() method to send the new status message - in this
  example<br>
  &quot;Testing 123&quot; - to Twitter. That&#39;s how simple it is to
  update your Twitter<br>
  status with twyt! We continue...</p>

  <p>s = data.Status()<br>
  s.load_json(return_val)</p>

  <p>print s</p>

  <p>t.status_destroy(s.id)</p>

  <p>This snippet shows how to use a data.Status() object to make sense
  of the<br>
  data that Twitter returns when we post our new status message. Once
  the<br>
  returned data (return_val) is loaded into the Status object s, the
  Status<br>
  object represents the status message returned. `print s&#39; prints a
  string<br>
  representation of the status message (see docs for the format). We
  then<br>
  decide our status message was boring and call status_destroy() on its
  ID to<br>
  tell Twitter to delete the status message. That&#39;s about all you
  need to get<br>
  started. See the pydocs in twitter.py (import twyt.twitter;
  help(twitter))<br>
  to see the rest of the Twitter API functions you can call.</p>

  <p>o That&#39;s about as simple as it gets. The world is now your
  oyster. Have fun!</p>

  Twyt 0.9.1 - Under The Same Stars<br>
  By Andrew Price, 2009-02-17 22:01:50 in Twyt. Leave a comment
  (Permalink)</a></p>

  <p>Twyt 0.9.1 has been released and is available to download from the
  usual place.<br>
  This release cycle has been pushed along by suggestions, patches and
  testing<br>
  from users of the twyt command line client, so the twyt Twitter API
  module has<br>
  only undergone some tweaks and just a few additions to the set of
  supported API<br>
  methods.<br>
  Changes to the twyt client include:<br>
  A &#39;namecache&#39; subcommand, intended for making tab completion
  scripts more<br>
  useful<br>
  Better support for using twyt in pipelines (you can now pipe messages
  into<br>
  &#39;twyt tweet&#39;)<br>
  Now prints screen names instead of real names (by popular demand)<br>
  A &#39;sing&#39; subcommand (it&#39;s silly, but it gets used)<br>
  Better non-ASCII character handling<br>
  The #twyt hashtag is getting used quite regularly now, but for bug
  reports and<br>
  patches please stick to good, old-fashioned email.<br>
  Twyt 0.9.0 - Flowers On The Ceiling<br>
  By Andrew Price, 2009-01-04 09:20:12 in Twyt. Leave a comment
  (Permalink)</p>

  <p>Twyt 0.9.0 has been released and is available to download from the
  usual place.<br>
  The python-twyt packages in Debian and Fedora will be updated
  shortly.<br>
  This release incorporates lots of little fixes, and updates which
  were required<br>
  to keep up with changes to the Twitter API. Scripts which import
  previous<br>
  versions of twyt may need updating.<br>
  The accompanying command line client, twyt, has also been improved.
  In<br>
  particular it has better support for multiple Twitter accounts and
  allows you to<br>
  flag one username as the default. It also now uses simplejson to
  store user<br>
  configuration so the .ini-style config files generated with older
  versions of<br>
  twyt will be ignored (apologies for the inconvenience, to the three
  people who<br>
  use it).<br>
  Note that the number of Twitter API methods which twyt supports has
  not<br>
  increased - I&#39;ll get around to adding support for more of them
  next time I&#39;m in<br>
  the mood. Meanwhile, if you&#39;re a Python coder and you&#39;ve got
  nothing better to<br>
  do, feel free to read the APITODO file to see what&#39;s missing and
  email me a<br>
  patch, or the URL of your bzr branch. It&#39;s easy-peasy stuff.<br>
  Twyt 0.8.5 - Dancing Like Astley<br>
  By Andrew Price, 2008-05-18 00:44:09 in Twyt. Leave a comment
  (Permalink)<br>
  Twyt 0.8.5 has been unleashed. Twyt is a python Twitter API library
  and<br>
  accompanying command line Twitter client.<br>
  This version improves greatly on the previous command line interface
  with added<br>
  --help for each subcommand. The client code has been rejigged to use
  Python&#39;s<br>
  optparse making it more scalable and flexible than before. It also
  has better<br>
  local timezone and DST support. Here&#39;s a quick example:<br>
  andy@plato:~$ twyt --commands<br>
  Usage: twyt COMMAND [options] [args]</p>

  <p>Available commands:<br>
  archive Shows 80 of your status messages ordered by date of
  posting<br>
  delete Deletes a tweet by ID<br>
  direct Sends a direct message to another user<br>
  directdel Delete a direct message which was sent to you<br>
  directsent Prints the 20 last direct messages sent by you<br>
  directtl Prints the 20 last direct messages sent to you<br>
  friendstl Returns 20 most recent statuses in your (or USERNAME&#39;s)
  friends<br>
  timeline<br>
  publictl Shows the 20 most recent statuses in Twitter&#39;s public
  timeline<br>
  replies Show the Nth page of 20 replies (messages with @yourusername
  in<br>
  them)<br>
  savepass Saves your username and password for subsequent use<br>
  show Show a single status message by ID<br>
  tweet Updates the authenticating user&#39;s Twitter status<br>
  usertl Show your timeline, or USERNAME&#39;s timeline</p>

  <p>For command-specific help, use twyt COMMAND --help<br>
  andy@plato:~$ twyt tweet &quot;Showing off Twyt&#39;s cool, new,
  helpful, optparsed<br>

  href=&quot;http://andrewprice.me.uk/projects/twyt&quot;&gt;Twyt&lt;/a&gt;)<br>

  Next on the TODO list for Twyt are better support for multiple
  Twitter accounts<br>
  and more complete support for the rest of the API functions. A
  handful of new<br>
  API functions has appeared over the last few months so it&#39;ll be a
  challenge to<br>
  catch up. My aim is to release version 1.0 once the whole API is
  supported in<br>
  Twyt.<br>
  Updated python-twyt packages will hit Debian unstable very soon and
  Fedora as<br>
  soon as I&#39;ve finished upgrading to Fedora 9 (modulo studying for
  my final exams<br>
  which start on Monday).<br>
  Tracking Commits With Twitter And Twyt<br>
  By Andrew Price, 2008-04-04 12:46:22 in Twyt. Leave a comment
  (Permalink)</p>

  <p>The python-twyt package provides a Twitter client API library
  (&#39;from twyt import<br>
  twitter&#39;) and a command line client (&#39;twyt&#39;) which uses
  the library. One way to<br>
  use it is to integrate twyt into a shell script to automate your
  Twitter<br>
  updates. Here&#39;s an example.<br>
  Sally the software maintainer wants to let her development team keep
  track of<br>
  repository commits while they&#39;re away from their computers. She
  installs<br>
  python-twyt, sets up a Twitter account for her project and tells twyt
  the<br>
  username and password for that account. She then writes a shell
  script which<br>
  parses from the email details such as the short commit log and the
  link to the<br>
  commit diff in the repository&#39;s web interface and calls:<br>
  twyt tweet &quot;$devname $shortlog $link&quot;<br>
  Sally also sets up a procmail rule to pipe emails from her
  project&#39;s commits<br>
  list into her script.<br>
  So when an email arrives from the commits list procmail triggers the
  script,<br>
  sending the summary to Twitter. It then gets distributed to
  Sally&#39;s followers,<br>
  whether they&#39;re using email, SMS or any of the other supported
  notification<br>
  methods. The developers (who are clearly very dedicated) smile at
  being able to<br>
  keep track of the project on their mobile devices while they&#39;re
  out grocery<br>
  shopping or in the bath.<br>
  I&#39;m not sure if this would be a highly desirable real-world
  application of twyt<br>
  but it&#39;s one possibility. If anyone implements it, do let me
  know. It&#39;s worth<br>
  noting, however, that Twitter does have usage limits and won&#39;t
  accept over a<br>
  certain amount of updates per hour or send over a certain number of
  SMS messages<br>
  to each user per week.<br>
  [Update: Dave Murphy has just reminded me that you can bypass the
  whole mailing<br>
  list stage by using the commit hooks for your code repository to
  trigger the<br>
  script]<br>
  Twyt 0.8 - Coming At You Like A Buzzard<br>
  By Andrew Price, 2008-01-27 14:01:40 in Twyt. Leave a comment
  (Permalink)<br>
  I&#39;ve just released Twyt 0.8. It includes added support for
  Twitter user<br>
  functions, better HTTP error handling, improved documentation and
  status<br>
  messages posted with the twyt command line client now show up as
  &#39;from Twyt&#39;<br>
  instead of &#39;from web&#39;. The Fedora and Debian python-twyt
  packages will be<br>
  updated shortly.<br>
  [ P.S. This will be the first of my blog entries to pop up on Planet
  Fedora, so<br>
  hello to all you Fedorable people! ]<br>
  Twyt (Reprise)<br>
  By Andrew Price, 2008-01-06 17:21:10 in Twyt. Leave a comment
  (Permalink)<br>
  Since the majority of twyt&#39;s code is reusable I&#39;ve decided to
  brand it as an<br>
  alternative Twitter API Python module instead of just a command line
  client.<br>
  It&#39;s pretty simple to use, as exemplified by the following
  exciting and<br>
  contrived Python session:<br>
  &gt;&gt;&gt; from twyt import twitter, data<br>
  &gt;&gt;&gt; t = twitter.Twitter()<br>
  &gt;&gt;&gt; t.set_auth(&quot;username&quot;,
  &quot;password&quot;)<br>
  &gt;&gt;&gt; return_val = t.status_update(&quot;Test&quot;)<br>
  &gt;&gt;&gt; s = data.Status()<br>
  &gt;&gt;&gt; s.load_json(return_val)<br>
  &gt;&gt;&gt; print s<br>
  [568644162] Andy Price: Test (Sun Jan 06 16:10:53 +0000 2008 via
  web)<br>
  &gt;&gt;&gt; print s.id<br>
  568644162<br>
  &gt;&gt;&gt; t.status_destroy(s.id)<br>
  A quick run through the code: set_auth() tells the Twitter object
  your username<br>
  and password. Then status_update() sends your status message to
  Twitter and<br>
  return_val is set to the JSON formatted string that Twitter sends
  back. We then<br>
  load the JSON string into a Status object which lets us access the
  returned data<br>
  (the details of the new status message) conveniently. We then pass
  the id of the<br>
  new status message into status_destroy() which tells Twitter to
  delete the<br>
  status message, because it&#39;s boring.<br>
  The docs in the classes are pretty good so help() should be your
  friend. Go<br>
  forth and write super-shiny twyt-based applications.<br>
  Twyt is now in Fedora Rawhide and Debian Unstable, so it should
  propagate into<br>
  Ubuntu Hardy Heron (universe) soon. Those of you brave enough to run
  Rawhide,<br>
  Unstable and Hardy can install twyt using &#39;yum install
  python-twyt&#39; or &#39;apt-get<br>
  install python-twyt&#39; respectively. Alternatively, just grab the
  latest tarball.<br>
  Twyt - A Command Line Twitter Client<br>
  By Andrew Price, 2007-12-27 05:53:53 in Twyt. Leave a comment
  (Permalink)<br>
  Allow me to introduce my new little python program named Twyt
  (randomly chosen<br>
  but could be backronymed to &quot;That&#39;s what you
  think&quot;).<br>
  Twyt allows you to post twitter messages, delete them, view your
  friends&#39; latest<br>
  messages and view other various twitter &quot;timelines&quot; from
  the command line. It&#39;s<br>
  very young and really only does enough stuff to keep me happy so it
  might be<br>
  lacking in features that others may desire. Patches welcome, as
  usual.<br>
  I wrote twyt a couple of weeks ago after I couldn&#39;t find a
  twitter client that<br>
  met my standards and stumbled across the Twitter API docs. If you
  prefer GUI<br>
  clients, it shouldn&#39;t be too hard to import twyt&#39;s twitter.py
  (or commands.py<br>
  for that matter) and write a nice, shiny front-end for it. I&#39;ve
  tried to<br>
  document it quite well for that purpose - see the GUIHOWTO file for a
  possible<br>
  example. Twyt uses the JSON interfaces to the Twitter functions and
  depends on<br>
  the simplejson python library.<br>
  Have fun.<br>
