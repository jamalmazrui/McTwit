McTwit, a Windows desktop client designed for accessible and efficient use, is a retired project due to changes in the Twitter security API that required extensive code changes.  In the spirit of open source software, however, I am publishing the last version of McTwit in case any of its code or ideas may benefit projects by other developers.

Full documentation is in the file McTwit.htm.  McTwit27.zip is an archive of a fresh installation of McTwit 2.7.

More information about McTwit is excerpted from its user guide as follows:

McTwit is a free, open source desktop client for Twitter.com, a popular social networking site.  The program is designed for productivity by keyboard users.  Additionally, if the JAWS, System Access, or Window-Eyes screen reader is active, some information is conveyed efficiently through direct speech messages.  Such messages are also displayed on the status line for visual users.

McTwit works on almost any version of Windows, including 64-bit Vista.  Its use of standard controls tends to maximize accessibility.  Programmed in a cross-platform language, the source code is also relatively easy for interested developers to port to other operating systems.  A command-line version of McTwit is included in the distribution, as well as the more powerful GUI version.

Twitter is being used to get bulletins about public or company news with links to web pages for more information.  People ask quick questions or express informal opinions on Twitter that they would not do by email.  Direct, private messages may also be exchanged.  

McTwit's flexible, direct access to Twitter features makes it convenient to explore and communicate interactively.  You can select a user either by pointing to a list item or entering a screen name.  Get a list of someone's tweets, followers, or leaders with a single keystroke.  Go to a related URL, subscribe to tweets, post a public reply, or send a private message.  McTwit offers full access to a leading networking technology!
